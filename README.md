# Reversible and Robust Image Steganography using Multi-Scale Convolution, Embedding Block, and Evaluation against SRNet

This repository contains the full implementation of a novel and lightweight framework for **reversible and robust image steganography**, combining:
- Multi-Scale Convolutional layers
- A Compact Embedding Block
- A lightweight UNet Architecture

## Highlights
- High visual quality of stego images
- Strong resistance against deep learning-based steganalyzers (e.g., **SRNet** and CNN)
- Tested on the **DIV2K** dataset
- Includes **PSNR/SSIM evaluation** and final **qualitative visual comparisons**

## Dataset
We used the [DIV2K dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) for training and evaluation.
Due to size constraints, the dataset is hosted separately on **Google Drive**:
